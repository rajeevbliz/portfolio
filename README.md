## Overview

This repository represents my personal portfolio —
a curated space for my work, ideas, and ongoing experiments.

The goal is simple: **show real execution**, not noise.

## About

I’m a full-stack developer building modern web experiences
with a focus on **clarity, usability, and long-term maintainability**.

I’m intentional about what I build and how I build it.
Clean systems matter more than flashy demos.
